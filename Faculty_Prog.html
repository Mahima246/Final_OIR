                        Shastri Indo-Canadian Institute has announced its programmes for the year 2018-19. It's a
                        reminder call as the deadline is approaching fast and only 15 days are left to submit the

                      <p>SFU and MITACS have partnered to launch a student exchange program to send and receive students
                        with the Indian Institute of Technology. The goal of this partnership is to raise the profile of
                        SFU in India in general, attract the top students from India to SFU for undergraduate and
                        graduate studies, foster collaborations with IIT faculty leading to more collaborative research
                        and joint grants etc. and to provide SFU students an opportunity to experience research in India
                        at the IITs thereby broadening their horizons on the systems in place in another part of the
                        world.

                        More information at the MITACS-GRA site:

                        http://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/globalink-research-award</p>
                      <p>Forms that the student needs to fill are under "How to Apply" tab on above link or here is
                        direct URL:<a

                      <p>FAQ's</p>
                      <p>1) I am an IIT student, how do I proceed?

                        Ans: Find a faculty member at SFU in your area of interest and contact them with your CV and
                        expression of interest. You will also need an 'anchor' for the internship on the IIT-end so
                        please find a faculty member at IIT willing to supervise you from that side. It would be useful
                        if you can look at the MITACS forms above, fill them out and send them along with your emails to
                        both the faculty contacts (at SFU and IIT).

                        http://www.sfu.ca/engineering.html

                        http://www.sfu.ca/computing.html

                        http://www.sfu.ca/mechatronics.html

                      </p>
                      <p>2) What level of students are eligible?

                        Ans: The exchange is open to all IIT students, undergraduate or graduate. Undergraduate students
                        in the third year or beyond will get preference but undergraduate students in the second year
                        are also encouraged to apply. All graduate students, Master's or PhD are eligible and encouraged
                        to seek a host lab at SFU for their research.
                      </p>
                      <p>3) Is there a deadline?

                        Ans: This exchange is open all year around, till the seats allocated are filled up. For
                        undergraduate students looking to visit Vancouver in summer period to coincide with your summer
                        holidays, it would be important to start early. Normally, MITACS will take 4 weeks to approve
                        completed paperwork filed with them. The visa process in India will take some time.Factor these
                        times to get an idea of when you have to start to seek SFU faculty interest to apply.</p>
                      <p>4) Who do I contact?

                        Ans: See point (1) above. Find your host lab from these links and contact your host lab
                        Professor directly with your CV.

                        <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/engineering.html "></a>

                        http://www.sfu.ca/computing.html

                        http://www.sfu.ca/mechatronics.html

                        Find an anchor at the IIT side, a Professor their who can supervise your internship from that
                        end.</p>
                      <p>5) The MITACS link shows the deadline has passed.

                        Ans: This program is a parallel new program to the MITACS GRA program and it is specific to IIT
                        and SFU student exchange. It uses the same template forms as the regular MITACS GRA but it is
                        open all year around. Do not worry about deadline being passed.</p>
                      <p>6) Is this exchange open to any lab at SFU?

                        Ans: Yes, you can find any supervisor at SFU whose research you are interested in working on.
                        Faculty of Applied Science interns will however get an additional stipend of $2000 CAD.

                      </p>
                      <p>7) Where do I send completed applications?

                        Ans: Applicants should submit completed application packages to SFUâ€™s Mitacs representative
                        Allison Brennan at mitacsbd@sfu.ca with a cc to Mirza Faisal Beg ( mfbeg@sfu.ca) if you are
                        applying to a FAS faculty member.

                      <p>Shell, a global group of energy and petrochemicals companies, has joined forces with the
                        Massachusetts Institute of Technology to address the energy challenges of the future.
                        We seek applications for a postdoctoral researcher to pursue energy research at MIT in
                        Cambridge, Massachusetts with MIT faculty on a Shell-sponsored research project. The goal of the
                        project is to examine applications of compressive sensing and machine learning methods to
                        geophysical and petroleum engineering problems.
                        This postdoctoral candidate will focus specifically on applications of these methods to
                        estimating reservoir fluid flow parameters given observations in drilled wells.</p>

                        academic record; and academic background in the appropriate field(s) specified above.
                        Candidates should have interest in integrating the following focus areas of the current project
                        into their research: machine learning; compressive sensing/sparse approximations; convex
                        optimization.
                        Successful candidates should have received their PhD within three years of the postdoc start
